# lc0-ubuntu-unofficial-builds

[Lc0](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0) is an open source neural network based chess engine.

This repository contains several builds of Lc0 for [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/).\
I builded them for personal use, so _this is not an official Lc0 repository_.\
Maybe some will find this useful since [official releases](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases)
are only for Android and Windows.

The files `lc0-v0.28.2-linux*` & `lc0-v0.29-linux*` were builded on Ubuntu 18.04.\
The files `lc0-v0.30-linux*` were builded on Ubuntu 23.04 (with [CUDA<sup>®</sup>](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) 11) and Ubuntu 23.10 (with CUDA 12).\
The files `lc0-v0.31-linux*` were builded on Ubuntu 24.04 (with [CUDA<sup>®</sup>](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) 12).
