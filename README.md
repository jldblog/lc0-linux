# lc0-linux

This repository contains several builds of Lc0.
I builded them for personal use.
Maybe some will find this useful.

For detailed explanations see https://jldblog.eu/series/lc0/ (in French).

For Lc0 official releases (Android & Windows) see https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases.
